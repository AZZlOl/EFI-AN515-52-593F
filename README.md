# EFI-AN515-52-593F
Hackintosh EFI files for AN515-52-593F  

I've kept BigSur on external HDD (works with USB 3.0 Port)  
Display goes black for 2 - 3 mins after the MacOS Loading Bar fills up fully. I press Ctrl button and wait for a minute or two for the display to show the login screen. (This happens while installing too, so don't hard reboot it, just wait)

  Screen Brightness  
  Audio (Jack and Speakers)

# Credits
  There was this Github Page that had this EFI. I copied it from there, but now that GitHub page doesn't exist.  
  He made this possible for me as I was getting stuck on something and couldn't go over it no matter what.
